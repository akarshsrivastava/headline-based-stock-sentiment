# headline-based-stock-sentiment

Stock related news headlines related are one of the major sources of information for investors. Often stock related news impacts the movement of a stock. If the headline sentiment is positive, often stock movement trend is towards increasing. Similarly, if the headline sentiment is negative, often stock movement trend is towards decreasing. But, often there headlines that are not decisive in themselves. These may or may impact the stock movement significantly.

This model takes news headline or collection of news headlines for a stock and provides an overall sentiment that can be helpful in predicting the stock movement in the market.

Here, I used a 'reuters 3500+ stocks since 2017' dataset for my experiment.

Please check the python notebook (stock_sentiment_using_headline_reuters_2017_onwards_data.ipynb) to go through the code. 

I will deploy this model as web app so that this project has a real life utility.
