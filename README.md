# headline-based-stock-sentiment

Many financial firms, hedge funds and retail investors use financial models to understand the market trend so as to make informed decision which could provide profitable outcomes. These firms, hedge funds and retail investors use historical data of the companies in the form stock prices, balance sheets, performance reports for making their decisions With more and more advancement in technology that is supported by computational capabilities, machine learning and deep learning techniques are proving to be very useful.

The analysts try to analyze the available data in order to make informed guesses because one can never be 100% accurate in this case. They often are updated with the latest news, study the company history, industry trends and other information that go into making a prediction. Can machine learning and deep learning algorithms/techniques help in predicting stock prices ?

Stock related news headlines related are one of the major sources of information for investors. Often stock related news impacts the movement of a stock. If the headline sentiment is positive, often stock movement trend is towards increasing. Similarly, if the headline sentiment is negative, often stock movement trend is towards decreasing. But, often there headlines that are not decisive in themselves. These may or may impact the stock movement significantly.

This model takes news headline or collection of news headlines for a stock and provides an overall sentiment that can be helpful in predicting the stock movement in the market.

Refer the python notebook (stock_sentiment_using_headline_reuters_2017_onwards_data.ipynb) to go through the code.

# Software and Libraries

For this project, I have used the following software and Python libraries:

1. python version >= python 2.7
2. numPy
3. pandas
4. matplotlib
5. scikit-learn
